# Bird Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

## Project Overview

This project centers around the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for the classification of bird images. The model is trained to distinguish among 525 bird species, encompassing a dataset of 90,000 images.

## Key Highlights

- **CNN Model Development:** Developed a robust Convolutional Neural Network model in PyTorch tailored for the classification of bird images, considering the diversity of 525 bird species.

- **Data Augmentation and Normalization:** Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training dataset and data normalization to ensure consistent and effective model training.

- **Utilization of Pretrained Models:** Leveraged the power of pretrained models, including AlexNet and ResNet, and fine-tuned them to adapt to the specific output requirements for the bird species classification task.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of the model on test data, identifying the best-performing model with an impressive accuracy of 98%.

**Note:** This notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab.
